## Introduction
This report provides insights into the employee structure at **Palmoria**, with a primary focus on gender-based analysis across departments and locations. It also includes evaluations of salary distributions, regulatory compliance, and bonus allocation.

## Project Overview
Palmoria's management seeks to understand employee distribution, identify potential gender pay gaps, assess regulatory salary compliance, and allocate bonuses based on performance ratings. This analysis serves as a tool for improved decision-making and HR policy enhancements.
